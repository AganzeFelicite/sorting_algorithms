this is the project of on sorting algorithms

    At least four different sorting algorithms
    What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
    How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
    What is a stable sorting algorithm

   put in application all most all the concpets of c programming
        NB: THIS WAS TO BE A TEAM PROJECT BUT DUE TO LACK OF A PEER I DECIDED TO DO IT ALONE
